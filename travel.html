        When I'm not writing code, I'm usually behind a camera or planning the next trip. 
        Photography taught me patience and perspective — two things that make me a better engineer. 
        These are some places I've been, stories I want to remember.

          <h2>Himalayas, India</h2>
          <time>Summer 2024</time>
          <p>
            Three weeks in the mountains. No cell service, no email, just trails and clouds. 
            I went to disconnect and ended up thinking more clearly than I had in months. 
            Sometimes the best debugging happens when you step away from the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Captured sunrise at 14,000 feet. The air was thin, the light was perfect, 
            and for a few minutes, nothing else mattered.

          <h2>Kyoto, Japan</h2>
          <time>Spring 2024</time>
          <p>
            Cherry blossoms, temples, and quiet streets at dawn. Kyoto reminded me that 
            beauty doesn't have to be loud. The best moments are often the quietest ones — 
            a lesson I try to apply to code, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spent mornings photographing gardens and evenings exploring ramen shops. 
            Found a balance between structure and spontaneity that I brought back to my work.

          <h2>Iceland</h2>
          <time>Winter 2023</time>
          <p>
            Midnight sun in summer, northern lights in winter. Iceland is a photographer's dream 
            and a reminder that nature operates on a different scale than we do. 
            Humbling and beautiful in equal measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chased waterfalls, drove through snowstorms, and learned that sometimes you can't 
            plan everything — you just have to adapt. Much like production deployments.

          <h2>Scottish Highlands</h2>
          <time>Autumn 2023</time>
          <p>
            Moody skies, ancient castles, and landscapes that felt pulled from a different era. 
            The Highlands taught me patience — waiting hours for the right light, 
            walking miles for the right shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's something meditative about landscape photography. You can't rush it, 
            you can't force it. You just show up and wait for the moment.

          <h2>Kerala Backwaters, India</h2>
          <time>Winter 2022</time>
          <p>
            Slow boats, palm trees, and sunsets that looked unreal. 
            Kerala is where I learned to slow down and appreciate the moment. 
            Not everything needs to be optimized for efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my favorite photos came from just sitting still and observing. 
            No agenda, no rush — just presence.

          <h2>New Zealand</h2>
          <time>Summer 2022</time>
          <p>
            Mountains, lakes, and endless hiking trails. New Zealand is where adventure meets tranquility. 
            Every turn felt like a postcard, every sunrise worth waking up for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Photographed the Milky Way for the first time here. Clear skies, minimal light pollution, 
            and a reminder of how small we are in the grand scheme of things.

      <h2>On Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Photography is my way of slowing down. In a world of instant notifications and constant context-switching, 
        standing behind a camera forces me to be present. To observe. To wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shoot mostly with natural light, minimal editing. I'm drawn to simplicity — 
        clean compositions, muted colors, moments that feel honest. 
        The same principles I apply to code: clarity, restraint, and intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        These travel entries are perpetually outdated. New adventures happen, old ones fade into memory. 
        But that's okay. The point isn't to document everything — it's to remember what mattered.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="gear">
      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <p>
        I keep it simple: one camera, two lenses, and a tripod. 
        Sony α7 III, 24-70mm for versatility, 85mm for portraits. 
        Less gear means more focus on the shot.
