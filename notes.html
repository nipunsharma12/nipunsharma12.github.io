        <h2><a href="#on-simplicity">On Simplicity in System Design</a></h2>
        <p>
          The best systems are the ones you can explain in a few sentences. Complexity is easy — 
          anyone can add another service, another queue, another layer. Simplicity is hard. 
          It requires discipline, restraint, and the courage to say no.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent years building distributed systems, and the pattern is always the same: 
          start simple, scale gradually, resist the urge to over-engineer. The systems that 
          survive are the ones that solve one problem exceptionally well, not ten problems poorly.

        <h2><a href="#boring-tech">In Defense of Boring Technology</a></h2>
        <p>
          PostgreSQL. Redis. Python. These aren't exciting choices. They're not going to get you 
          on the front page of Hacker News. But they're reliable, well-documented, and proven at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every new technology comes with a cost: learning curve, debugging time, operational overhead. 
          Save your innovation tokens for problems that actually matter. Use boring technology for 
          everything else.

        <h2><a href="#monitoring">Monitoring Is Not Observability</a></h2>
        <p>
          Monitoring tells you that something is wrong. Observability tells you why. 
          Dashboards full of metrics are useless if you can't answer: "What changed? Where? Why now?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Build systems that explain themselves. Structured logging, distributed tracing, 
          correlation IDs. When production breaks at 3 AM, you'll thank yourself for the clarity.

        <h2><a href="#tech-interviews">What I Look for in Technical Interviews</a></h2>
        <p>
          Not how many algorithms you've memorized. Not whether you can reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard. 
          I care about how you think, how you communicate, and how you approach problems you haven't seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you break down a complex system? Do you ask clarifying questions? Do you consider trade-offs? 
          These are the skills that matter when you're debugging a production outage, not LeetCode scores.

        <h2><a href="#databases">Databases Are Not Caches</a></h2>
        <p>
          Every few months, someone proposes using Redis as the primary datastore. 
          Every time, I explain why that's a bad idea. Databases guarantee durability. 
          Caches optimize for speed. These are fundamentally different problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the right tool for the job. PostgreSQL for your source of truth. 
          Redis for temporary, high-speed access. Elasticsearch for search. 
          Don't try to make one tool do everything.

        <h2><a href="#code-reviews">Code Reviews Are About Communication</a></h2>
        <p>
          The goal of code review isn't to catch bugs (though that's nice). 
          It's to share knowledge, align on patterns, and build better engineers. 
          A good code review makes the team stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be specific, be kind, and explain the "why" behind your comments. 
          Point out what's done well, not just what needs fixing. 
          Code review is where culture gets built, one comment at a time.
